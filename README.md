# Keylogger
-->  This is a project that I had been dreaming to work on since I was in high school . 


-->  Its a keylogger tool that can be used to log anything you type on your device it captures all the data and sends it back to you. 


-->  This tool can be used to steal credentials and invade privacy.

-->  **This project does not promote any illegal activities and is provided for educational purpose only.**

-->  **This project wouldn't be possible without the knowledge I gained from David Bombal I would like to thank him for his amazing videos.**
